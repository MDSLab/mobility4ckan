#Mobility 4 CKAN

Mobility 4 CKAN is an Android application, developed by the Mobile and Distributed Systems Lab (MDSLab) at the University of Messina, Italy, that helps in tracking IoT device fleets on a map while these roam around, by pushing in real-time relevant data (coordinates, speed) to an instance of the CKAN OpenData CMS, at the same time collecting and pushing measurements of interest from any onboard sensor.
